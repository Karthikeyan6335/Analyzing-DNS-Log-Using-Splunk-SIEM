This project uses Splunk SIEM to upload and analyze DNS log files for monitoring network activity. It extracts key DNS fields like source IP and domain name to detect normal and abnormal traffic patterns. By running SPL queries, it identifies suspicious or malicious DNS behaviors such as malware communication. This helps beginners learn practical network security monitoring and threat detection. The project is a hands-on introduction to using Splunk for cybersecurity log analysis
